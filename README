Lua-GD is a library that provides access to the Thomas Boutell's
GD library from Lua. It's BETA software and it continues under

    * All functions are loaded on a single table called 'gd'.
    * No 'Image' prefix.
    * Methods uses camelCase names and begins with lower case letters.
    * Constants uses upper case names, separated by underscores. 
    * All functions, except gd.create*, gd.gifAnimEnd*, gd.fontCache* and
      gd.useFontConfig, can use the colon operator for a more object
      oriented access.

    * Support the new package proposal for Lua 5.1
